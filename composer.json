    "description": "First setup of an API to exchange Learning Analytics. This API is based on events (inspired by Caliper AnalyticsÂ® Specification, version 1.1) that are send to the api. We use a number of events.  The view event is used to register page views for theory.  The grade event is used to register results of doing assignments. Such a result is modelled as a score.  The assesment event is used to register the completion of an assignment. This information is transfered as an attempt.  Both theory and assignments are considered digital resources. An assignment is an assignable digital resource.  A student is seen as an actor.",
